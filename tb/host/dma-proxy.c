/* DMA Proxy
 *
 * This module is designed to be a small example of a DMA device driver that is
 * a client to the DMA Engine using the AXI DMA driver. It serves as a proxy for
 * kernel space DMA control to a user space application.
 *
 * A zero copy scheme is provided by allowing user space to mmap a kernel allocated
 * memory region into user space, referred to as a set of channel buffers.Ioctl functions 
 * are provided to start a DMA transfer (non-blocking), finish a DMA transfer (blocking) 
 * previously started, or start and finish a DMA transfer blocking until it is complete.
 * An input argument which specifies a channel buffer number (0 - N) to be used for the
 * transfer is required.
 *
 * By default the kernel memory allocated for user space mapping is going to be 
 * non-cached at this time. Non-cached memory is pretty slow for the application.
 * A h/w coherent system for MPSOC has been tested and is recommended for higher
 * performance applications. 
 *
 * Hardware coherency requires the following items in the system as documented on the 
 * Xilinx wiki and summarized below::
 *   The AXI DMA read and write channels AXI signals must be tied to the correct state to
 *    generate coherent transactions.
 *   An HPC slave port on MPSOC is required
 *   The CCI of MPSOC must be initialized prior to the APU booting Linux
 *   A dma-coherent property is added in the device tree for the proxy driver.
 *
 * There is an associated user space application, dma_proxy_test.c, and dma_proxy.h
 * that works with this device driver.
 *
 * The hardware design was tested with an AXI DMA with scatter gather and
 * with the transmit channel looped back to the receive channel. It should
 * work with or without scatter gather as the scatter gather mentioned in the 
 * driver is only at the s/w framework level rather than in the hw.
 *
 * This driver is character driver which creates 2 devices that user space can
 * access for each DMA channel, /dev/dma_proxy_rx and /dev/dma_proxy_tx.
 * An internal test mode is provided to allow it to be self testing without the 
 * need for a user space application and this mode is good for making bigger
 * changes to this driver.
 *
 * This driver is designed to be simple to help users get familiar with how to 
 * use the DMA driver provided by Xilinx which uses the Linux DMA Engine. In order
 * to get the maximum performance without a loss of receive data the hardware design
 * should incorporate AXI stream FIFOs prior to the DMA receive channel.
 *
 * To use this driver a node must be added into the device tree.  Add the 
 * following node while adjusting the dmas property to match the name of 
 * the AXI DMA node.
 * 
 * dma_proxy {
 *    compatible ="xlnx,dma_proxy";
 *    dmas = <&axi_dma_0 0
 *            &axi_dma_0 1>;
 *    dma-names = "dma_proxy_tx", "dma_proxy_rx";
 *		dma-coherent;		when MPSOC is configured coherent 
 * }
